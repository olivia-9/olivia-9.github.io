    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="ps">We want to celebrate the art of the past and present in its complexity and diversity, supporting artistic risktaking and deep scholarship. <br> This will be shared with all our audiences: in our buildings, in exhibitions we tour, through works we loan and across our digital platforms.<br></p>
  </div>
  <div class="sectionTwo" id="gallery" data-label="Gallery">
    <h2>Gallery</h2>
    <p class="ps2">We believe access to art is a universal human right and we see our galleries as sites of creative learning.<br> We want to champion the importance of making art and encourage people to explore the many ways in which art is created and to develop their own creative potential.</p>
    <p class="ps2">Our reach is already powerful. We intend to increase its impact across society, with art that will resonate around the world. <br>We will redefine museum experiences for the 21st century, offering a greater depth and range of experiences and offering visitors multiple points <br>of engagement with our collection and ideas about art.</p>
